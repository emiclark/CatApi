# CatApi
Download various cat images and descriptions into a tableview

1. ApiClient was created which returned the Json array
2. Created the Cat Model - the initializer takes a json dictionary to create each cat object.
3. Created data store - called ApiClient which returned an Array of dictionaries.
4. In order to create a Cat object, I had to enumerate through the json Array and used the initializer from the Cat model to create.
5. Created a tableview with custom tableviewcell.
